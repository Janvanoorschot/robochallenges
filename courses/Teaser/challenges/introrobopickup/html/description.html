<h1>Pick up the Beacon</h1>

<p>You can tell Robo to pick up stuff. Do you see the beacon to his upper right? We are going to make
    Robo pick it up.</p>

<p>As you can see the program has already partially been written, but is not quite correct.
    However, with only a small change it will work. Do you already see what change should be made?</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Adjust the program to make Robo pick up the beacon to his upper right.
</p>
