<p>Perhaps you did not know, but Robo can flip a coin. He does this with the instruction <span class="robocode">flipCoin</span>. 
You can make a dice by letting Robo flip the coin 6 times and then count the number of heads or tails.</p>

<p class="instruction">Try out the program a number of times and each time write down how many white 
dots Robo paints. Is it as you would expect?</p>
