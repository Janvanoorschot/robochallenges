<h1>Automatic vacuum cleaning</h1>

<p>
    The map shows a very big carpet on which someone has dropped 14 beacons.
    You can use your previous program with just some small addition so that Robo will automatically clean up all the beacons!
</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust your program to let Robo clean up all the beacons.</p>


<p>
    Hint: Consider that Robo now needs to find 14 beacons, rather than a single beacon as in the previous exercise.
    So he has to repeatedly search for another beacon ...
</p>

<p>Do you think Robo will go everywhere?</p>
<p>Extra: Let Robo leave a white trail behind him so that you can see where he went.</p>
