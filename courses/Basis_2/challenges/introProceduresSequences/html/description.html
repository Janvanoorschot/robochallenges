<h1>Sequences of procedures</h1>

<p>You can use procedures everywhere. Procedures do not depend on where you should start.
    That way you can use the same procedure in many different places!
</p>

<p>However, if you want to keep track of what Robo will do, it is very handy if he always finishes the procedure with some standard position and orientation.</p>

<p>That way you can easily use procedures in long combinations, like here to write a number down.</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Why don't you write your own number using the procedures <span class="robocode">number1</span> and <span class="robocode">number4</span>?
</p>
