<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/mazeBasisTurnLeft/images/mazeBasisTurnLeft.jpg" width=200></div>

<p>To let Robo find the beacon in a maze, we want him to always keep the wall to its right. When he has found the beacon, he is ready.</p>

<p>In this exercise we will explore the situation when there is something in front of the robot while he has the wall to his right. 
What should Robo do in this case?</p>

<p class="instruction">Add the new situation/condition to your script, so that Robo will also automatically find the beacon 
in this case.</p>
