<p>We also do not want Robo to put a beacon on a pothole on which there is already a beacon. 
So, we will also have to tell Robo how to prevent doing this.</p>

<p>In the <span class="robocode">procedure findPothole</span> Robo should only put down a beacon 
if <em>there is a pothole in front of him</em> AND <em>there is no beacon placed on top of it</em>.</p>

<p class="instruction">Improve your program, such that Robo does not undo his previous work anymore.</p>
