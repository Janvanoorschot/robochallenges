<h1>Put back the palm oil</h1>

<p>To let Robo do its job, you only have to tell him what the correct barcode for each product is and where to put it back. 
You do this in the <span class="robocode">procedure putProductBack</span>. Let’s start with palm oil.</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust the <span class="robocode">procedure putProductBack</span>, such that Robo will recognize the 
palm oil and bring it back to the right storage room.</p>
