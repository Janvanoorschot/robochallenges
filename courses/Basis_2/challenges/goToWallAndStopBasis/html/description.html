<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/goToWallAndStopBasis/images/goToWall.jpg" width=200></div>

<p>Robo has to move forward until he reaches the wall and should then stop. Do you remember how you made him do this?</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Complete the script to let the robot go to the wall and stop.
    Use <span class="robocode">end</span> to stop the robot.
    Do NOT count the number of steps until the wall!
</p>

<p> Remember that when a test turns out to be positive or true, the commands between the {} brackets following 
the <span class="robocode">if(.)</span> statement are executed? Otherwise the robot executes the commands between 
the {} brackets of the <span class="robocode">else</span> statement.</p>
