<h1>Using flipCoin</h1>

<p>
    Robo can flip a coin too! The command <span class="robocode">flipCoin</span> does the same thing as when you would flip a real coin:
    in 50% of the cases you will find heads up, and in the other 50% you will find "tails" up.
</p>

<p>
    It is not so, by the way, that head and tails take turns: it is perfectly possible that you will
    have a sequence of 5 times tails. It is only not very likely (3%).
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Push the <i class="icon-play-sign"></i> button a number of times to see if Robo turns right or left.</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Why don't you make a small program of your own using the <span class="robocode">flipCoin</span>?
</p>
