<p>We would not want Robo to pick up a beacon which he already placed on a pothole.
That way he would just undo his previous work!</p>

<p>In the <span class="robocode">procedure findBeacon</span> Robo should only pick up a beacon 
if <em>there is a beacon in front of him</em> AND it <em>is not placed on a pothole</em>.</p>

<p class="instruction">Improve your program, such that Robo does not undo his previous work anymore.</p>
