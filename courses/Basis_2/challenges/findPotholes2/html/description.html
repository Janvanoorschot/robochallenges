<h1>Find a pothole to fill with the beacon</h1>

<p>Robo now has to place the beacon he just found on a black pothole as you can see in the image below.</p>

<p class="instruction">Create a <span class="robocode">procedure findPothole</span>, in which Robo has 
to find a pothole (black dot) by randomly moving around. Let Robo put the beacon on the pothole once he finds it.</p>

<p>Hint: This procedure looks very much like <span class="robocode">findBeacon</span>.</p>
