<p>To let Robo find the beacon in a maze, we want him to always keep the wall to its right. When he has found the beacon, he is ready.</p>

<p>Remarkably enough you only have to tell Robo what to do in 4 situations. In the next exercises we will explore these situations 
one by one. Attention: the order in which you tell Robo about these situations is very important!</p>

<p>In this exercise we will explore two situations: (1) Robo has the beacon in front, and (2) the wall is to his right and 
there is nothing in front of him.</p>

<p class="instruction">Complete the script to let the robot automatically find the beacon and pick it up.</p>
