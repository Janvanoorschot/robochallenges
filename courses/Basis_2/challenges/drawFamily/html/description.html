<p>With the <span class="robocode">procedure head</span> you can draw a whole robot family with minimal effort. Let's see if we can 
draw eight portraits.</p>

<p class="instruction">Draw eight portraits in a <span class="robocode">repeat(8){...}</span> loop with the 
<span class="robocode">procedure head</span>.</p>

<p>Hint: After drawing a portrait be sure that Robo goes to the right position first <em>before</em> he starts to draw a new portrait. 
Otherwise he will make a mess of it ...</p>
