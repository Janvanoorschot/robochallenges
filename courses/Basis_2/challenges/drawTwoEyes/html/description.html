<h1>Draw two squares ...</h1>

<p>A procedure is only really handy if you can use it more often. For instance to draw 2 squares as in the picture below. 
Since you made the <span class="robocode">procedure square</span> already, you now only have to tell Robo <em>where</em> to draw 
the squares and not <em>how</em>. After all, that is just what is written in the procedure :-)</p>

<p class="instruction">Use the <span class="robocode">procedure square</span> twice to draw two squares next to each other 
as shown below.</p>

<p>Can you already see what Robo is drawing? Could these perhaps be the eyes of a robot?</p>
