<h1>Robo's cleanup program</h1>

<p>As you can see the program to clean up Robo's shop is already almost finished. However, it does not yet work correctly. 
That is what you are going to take care off!</p>

<p>It may perhaps seem like a big and difficult program, but don't worry! Do you see that there are only just a few procedures?
The program really only does 3 things which are also shown in the picture below.</p>

<p class="instruction">Inspect the program and try to understand it. Then go to the next challenge to do some real cleaning up.</p>
