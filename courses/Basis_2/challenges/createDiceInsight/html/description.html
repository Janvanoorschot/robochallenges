    The first dice we created was somewhat strange if you look at it.
    We know that the robot paints black or white every time.
    But what if his coin makes him paint six times black? Then he paints zero whites!
    Strange, because with ordinary dice you cannot throw zero ...

<p class="instruction">Adjust your program so Robo will paint white for at least one time and at most six times.</p>
