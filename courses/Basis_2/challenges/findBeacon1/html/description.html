<p>You can also use Robo’s coin to let him search in a haphazard kind of way. Just as if he is blindfolded really. 
Let's try out and see if he can find a beacon in this way.</p>

<p class="instruction">Complete the script such that Robo may find the beacon by chance. 
If he finds the beacon let him eat it up and then stop.</p> 

<p>Note: this can take a very long time, while it sometimes can be quick. Do you know why?</p>
