<p>We are going to draw a robot portrait. There is a lot of repetition in such a portrait (they all look the same). 
Using a procedure is then a good idea as we can use it again and again while we only have to tell Robo once what he has to do. 
Let's start with a procedure to paint a small square.</p>

 <p class="instruction">Create a <span class="robocode">procedure square</span> 
which let's Robo draw a square of 2x2 cells.</p>
