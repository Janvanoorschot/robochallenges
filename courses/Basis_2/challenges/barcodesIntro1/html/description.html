<p>In Robo's supermarket there are products left on the conveyor belt between the two white lines. 
Robo wants to put them back in the proper shelves. To this end he picks up one product at a time 
and reads its barcode. This way he knows what it is and where to return it to.</p>

<p>In the picture you see, for example, that the barcode for palm oil consists of two white stripes. 
You can also see that the program to do it, is already almost finished.</p>

<p class="instruction">Go to the next challenge to explore the program a bit further.</p>
