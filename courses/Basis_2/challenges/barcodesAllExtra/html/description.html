<p>Robo can now put everything back all by himself. However, he thinks the water storage is rather full. 
Therefore he decides that from now on water should be put in the same storage as the vegetables.</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust the <span class="robocode">procedure putProductBack</span>, such that Robo 
will also put the <em>water</em> into the <em>vegetable</em> storage as shown in the image below.</p>

<p>You might also want make a mess of it by returning everything to the wrong spot. In that case customers of Robo’s shop 
would have a hard time finding products back though. But do not let that stop you: 
in Robo’s supermarket that is all permitted :-)</p>
