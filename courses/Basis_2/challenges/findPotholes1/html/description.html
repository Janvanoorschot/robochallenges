<p>Do you still remember that by randomly driving around Robo could find beacons like in the vacuum cleaner exercise? 
Robo went ahead one step (if he could) and would sometimes go left and sometimes go right 
depending on flipping a coin with <span class="robocode">flipCoin</span>.</p>

<p class="instruction">Create a <span class="robocode">procedure findBeacon</span> to do it. Let Robo pick 
up the beacon once he finds it. Use <span class="robocode">flipCoin</span> to decide which direction Robo goes.</p> 

<p>Note: This can take Robo quite some time. Or very little time. If you're lucky ...</p>
