<h1>The procedure  <em>"turn"</em></h1>

<p>As you saw, you can say <em>"turn"</em> to Robo <em>only</em> if you make a procedure with the name <em>"turn"</em>.</p>

<p>However, if you only make a procedure nothing will happen.</p>

<p>You must also give Robo the instruction <span class="robocode">turn</span> to let him do it.</p>

<p class="instruction">In the script editor we have already given an example. Push the <i class="icon-play-sign"></i> button to see what happens.</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Why don't you make your own program using the <span class="robocode">procedure turn</span>?<br>
    For example to let Robo <span class="robocode">turn</span> 4 times, or 1 time in each square, or ... .
