<p>Rather then going to the beacon, Robo now has to go to the white dot. However, there are beacons in his way! 
Remove them with <span class="robocode">eatUp</span> so that he can continu his route.
</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust your program so that Robo will automatically find the white dot. Use 
<span class="robocode">eatUp</span> to remove the beacons which are in his way. Park Robo on the white dot.</p>
