<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/drawSquareProcedure/images/drawSquare.jpg" width=150></div>

<p>Robo has a secret language. When he paints a square, it is actually his secret way of saying "A". 
He invents the <span class="robocode">procedure secretA</span> for this. That way he only has to write 
down once what his secret letter "A" will look like. After that he can use it every time to write "A" in his secret language.</p>

 <p class="instruction">Create a <span class="robocode">procedure secretA</span> 
in which Robo draws a square of 3x3 cells. Use at least 
<span class="robocode">repeat(.){...}</span>, 
<span class="robocode">right</span>, and 
<span class="robocode">forward(2)</span>.</p>
