<h1>Finding beacons in a maze: turn right</h1>

<!-- image with challenge -->
<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/mazeBasisTurnRight/images/mazeBasisTurnRight.jpg" width=200></div>

<p>To let Robo find the beacon in a maze, we want him to always keep the wall to its right. When he has found the beacon, he is ready.</p>

<p>In this exercise we will explore the situation when there is sometimes no wall to Robo's right. 
What should he do in this case to keep the wall to his righthand side?</p>

<p class="instruction">Add the new situation/condition to your script, so that Robo will also automatically find the beacon 
in this case.</p>
