<p>Robots are very good at working on the conveyor-belt. Work which may be boring for humans does not matter for a robot. 
The robot also never gets tired and can often do simple tasks much faster than any human can do.</p>

<p>On the map you will find three beacons on the white conveyor-belt. The task of our robot is to put these beacons on 
the black conveyor-belt behind it.</p>

<p class="instruction">Let our robot move all beacons from the white onto the black conveyor-belt.</p>

<p class="instruction">Use at least  <span class="robocode">repeat(3)</span>, 
<span class="robocode">pickUp</span> and <span class="robocode">putDown</span>.</p>
