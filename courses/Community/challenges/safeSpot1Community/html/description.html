<p>As you can see, Robo is standing next to a wall and is looking for a safe spot. Somewhere to the left along the wall there is such a safe corner which is marked with a white dot. 
That's the spot where Robo wants to go!</p>

<p class="instruction">Let Robo find the safe spot. Use <span class="robocode">repeat{...}</span>, <span class="robocode">leftIsWhite</span>, <span class="robocode">forward(1)</span>, <span class="robocode">left</span>,
and <span class="robocode">end</span>.</p>
