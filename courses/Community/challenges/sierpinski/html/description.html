<p>A fractal is a mathematical set that typically displays self-similar patterns, 
which means it is "the same from near as from far". 
Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale, or, they may be nearly the same at different scales.
 The concept of fractal extends beyond trivial self-similarity and includes the idea of a detailed pattern repeating itself.</p>

<p> Sierpinski's Triangle is at the same time one of the most interesting and one of the simplest fractal shapes in existence.</p>
<p> There are different ways to create this pattern in a smart way. The solution using so-called "cellular automata" is especially suited to be programmed here. So try to find out more about this strategy yourself!</p>
