<p>
    If steps are often repeated it is easier to write those steps within a <span class="robocode">repeat(.){...}</span> loop.
    It saves you time and writing and you can change things much easier. For example if you are drawing a square and want it bigger or
    smaller.

<p class="instruction">Let the robot draw a square of 4x4 cells. Use
<span class="robocode">repeat(.){...}</span>, 
<span class="robocode">right</span>, and 
<span class="robocode">forward(3)</span> to do it.</p>
