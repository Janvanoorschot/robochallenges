<h1>Could you repeat that please?</h1>

<p>Robo is very good at repeating things. For example, repeatedly cleaning up corridors.</p>
<p>Now Robo needs to clean up three corridors. One way is to just copy the instructions to clean up one corridor.<p>
<p>However, you can also use the <span class="robocode">repeat</span> instruction.<p>

<p class="instruction">
    Single out the instructions you need to clean up one corridor, and surround them with a <span class="robocode">repeat</span> instruction.
    Make sure all (3) corridors are cleaned!
