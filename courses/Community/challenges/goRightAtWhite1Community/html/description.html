<p>Robo has to find a beacon and pick it up. For this purpose someone has left a trace of white dots which Robo can use to
    retrieve the beacon. This is quite similar to tracking and tracing! Do you know how Robo can find the beacon?</p>

<p>
    To see what is in front of the robot you can use, for example, <span class="robocode">frontIsWhite</span>. This tests if
    something white is in front and you can use it in combination with <span class="robocode">if(.){...} else {...}</span>
    to make the robot do either one thing or the other depending on the conditions he is facing.
</p>

<p class="instruction">Write a program so that the robot will automatically find the beacon by using the white dots. Use
    <span class="robocode">repeat{...}</span>,
    <span class="robocode">if(.){...} else {...}</span>, and
    <span class="robocode">frontIsWhite</span>.<p>

<p>See the documentation for an example to help you on your way.</p>
