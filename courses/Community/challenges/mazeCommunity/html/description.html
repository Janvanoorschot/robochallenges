<h1>The Maze Runner 1</h1>

<p>Robo has to automatically find the beacon in the maze.</p>
<p>One strategy is to always keep the wall to your right hand and follow it around corners and bends until you find the beacon.</p>
<p>We start with a simple maze, so you can quickly see if you are on the right track.</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Use this strategy to let Robo automatically find the beacon in the maze. Use at least
    <span class="robocode">repeat(.){...}</span>
    <span class="robocode">if(.){...}</span>, and
    <span class="robocode">rightIsClear</span>.
