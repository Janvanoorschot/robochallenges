<h1>Turn Robo in the right direction</h1>

<p>
    Robo is going to follow the white line, but is heading in the wrong direction (north).
    The first thing you need to do is to turn him in the right direction.
    By looking at the map you see that the white line is to the left (west).
    You can get Robo in the right direction by simply using the <span class="robocode">west(0)</span> command.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    1. Turn Robo so that he looks at the white line.
</p>

<p>
    Of course this only works for this map. See if you can come up with a more general way to turn him in the right direction.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    2. Find a more general way turn Robo in the right direction. Use, for example, <span class="robocode">repeat</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Hint: let Robo rotate until the white line is in front of him.
