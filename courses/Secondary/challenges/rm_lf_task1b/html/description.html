<h1>Follow the white line</h1>

<p>
    Your previous program made Robo automatically look in the right direction.
    Now let him follow the white line.
    Turn where necessary to stay on the line and pick up the beacon at the end.
</p>

<p class="instruction">1. Let Robo follow the white line and use at least:
    <span class="robocode">repeat</span>,
    <span class="robocode">left</span>,
    <span class="robocode">right</span>,
    <span class="robocode">forward</span>, and
    <span class="robocode">pickUp</span>,
</p>

<p>
    If this were a real robot you wouldn't want it crashing into things!
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    2. Be careful not to bump into the walls!
</p>

<p>
    Note that when you get to the end of the white line, there is a beacon.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    3. Go ahead and let Robo pick up the beacon as a reward for a job well done.

    If you are having trouble with this task, take a look at some of the "Basic Instructions" below or
    first have a look at these <a href="/go/course/robomind/Basis_1/Line%20following/0"><b>line following exercises</b></a>.
    Especially the "See" commands that allow the robot to determine what is around it.
    Loops and/or If-structures will be needed to control your robot's motion and to figure out when to stop.
