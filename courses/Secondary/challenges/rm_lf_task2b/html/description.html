<h1>Debris on the track: turn to the white line</h1>

<p>
    Robo now automatically finds the black spot, but is heading in the wrong direction (west) again.
    Get Robo's heading right. Do not use <span class="robocode">north(0)</span>.
    Instead use the more general purpose way we learned about earlier to let him find the right direction all by himself.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Let Robo head to the white line all by himself.
