<h1>Walking a grid: structured search</h1>

<p>
    Solve the grid with Method 1: structured grid search.
    Do not use "dead reckoning" to find the black spot.
    That is: by looking at the map, counting the squares, and then moving east and then south the correct number of squares.
    This is considered cheating.
    Write your code so that your robot can find the black spot no matter where it is placed on the grid.

<p class="instruction">
    1. Let the robot search the grid line by line to find the black spot.

<p class="instruction">
    2. Use <span class="robocode">procedures</span> to search each line.
