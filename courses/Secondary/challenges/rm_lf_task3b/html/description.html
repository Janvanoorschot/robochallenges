<h1>Walking a grid: random search</h1>

<p>
    Solve the grid with Method 2: make a random decision at every intersection of white lines about where to go.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Let the robot search the grid in a random fashion to find the black spot.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note</b>: this may take a long time and Robo will not always find the black spot fast enough. That is no problem.
    Robo did only not run until the end, because this may take a very long time and we did not want to keep you waiting.
    Try again and/or make your program smarter (next exercise) to see if Robo finds the spot this time."
