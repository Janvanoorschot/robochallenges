<h1>Debris on the track: follow the white line</h1>

<p>
    The program for this task is very similar to the program for the earlier line follow challenge.
    You just need to handle the black dots that Robo may encounter.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Continue with a copy of your earlier line follow program.
    Paste it below the current script which gets the robot to the start.
    Then make changes to the line follow part to solve this challenge.
</p>

<p>
    Hint: Pay particular attention to the black dot in the top-left corner.
    That one may be tricky, as Robo has to turn to find the white line again.
