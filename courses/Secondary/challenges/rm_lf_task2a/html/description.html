<h1>Debris on the track: go to the start</h1>

<p>
    Unfortunately there are now a few places where the white line is broken with a black spot.
    In case of a mail delivery robot, someone may have spilled a cup of coffee on the track,
    or somebody dropped something on it.
    We will have to make our robot smart enough to handle these interruptions in the white line.
</p>

<p>
    Note, however, that the robot is not at the head of the track.
    The first thing you need to do is to go to the start of the line, which is marked with a black dot.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    1. Let Robo turn until there is no obstacle in front of him, and then head forward until he is on the first black dot.
</p>

<p>
    You can get there by just doing a <span class="robocode">left</span> and then a <span class="robocode">forward(7)</span>,
    but it is a lot cooler (and robust) if you use the loops and turn until there is no obstacle in front, and then go <span class="robocode">forward(1)</span>
    until Robo is on top of the black spot.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    2. Let Robo automatically turn until there is no obstacle in front of him,
    and then head forward step-by-step until he is on the black dot.
    Use <span class="robocode">repeatWhile</span>.
