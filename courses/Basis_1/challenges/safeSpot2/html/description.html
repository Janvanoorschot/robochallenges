<h1>Robo is looking for another safe spot</h1>

<!-- image with challenge -->
<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/safeSpot2/images/whiteSpot2.jpg" width=300></div>

<p>In this map the safe spot is in another place! No worries: if you did it right your program from 
the previous exercise will also work here!</p>

<p class="instruction">Try your program also on this map.</p>

<p>In both environments Robo can automatically find the safe spot, 
because every time he first looks around before he decides what to do. He then only takes a small step/action. 
This way he does not miss anything and is able to make the right decisions.
