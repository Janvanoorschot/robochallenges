<p>The king has changed his mind. Vertical stripes are not so nice after all. He would now like Robo to draw 
horizontal stripes (These are stripes going from left-to-right or right-to-left).</p>

<p>This does not have to be much work for you. What is different from the previous exercise?</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust your program to let Robo now paint the floor with horizontal stripes.</p>
