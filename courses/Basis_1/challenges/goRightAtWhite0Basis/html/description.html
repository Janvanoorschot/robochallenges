<p>Robo has to find a beacon and pick it up. For this purpose someone has left a trace of white dots which Robo can use to 
retrieve the beacon. This is quite similar to tracking and tracing! Do you know how Robo can find the beacon?</p>

<p class="instruction">Finish the script so that Robo finds the beacon.</p>
