<h1>Create a robot dance</h1>

<p>We are now going to write some instructions with which we will make Robo dance. Let's see if we can make Robo really swing!</p>

<p class="instruction">Create your own robo dance. Use any commands you like.</p>

<p> Use, for example: 
<span class="robocode">forward(1)</span>, 
<span class="robocode">backward(1)</span>, 
<span class="robocode">pickUp</span>, 
<span class="robocode">left</span>, 
<span class="robocode">right</span>, 
<span class="robocode">leftIsClear</span>, or
<span class="robocode">rightIsClear</span>.
