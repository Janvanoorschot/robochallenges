<p>Robo has been asked by the king to paint the floor. This is because the king knows that 
robots can do this job nice and tidy and also very fast. The king wants the floor to be painted 
with vertical stripes (these are stripes going from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top).</p>

<p class="instruction">Adjust the script to let Robo paint the whole floor with vertical stripes.</p>
