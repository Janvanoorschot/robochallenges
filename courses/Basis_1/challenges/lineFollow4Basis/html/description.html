<h1>Get the beacon back</h1>

<!-- image with challenge -->
<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><img src="/content/lineFollow4Basis/images/lineFollow4.jpg" width=300></div>

<p>Now we want Robo not only to pick up the beacon at the end, but also bring it back to the starting point of the line and put it down ...
<br><br>To this end, we:
<ol>
<li>Let Robo turn around after picking up the beacon,</li>
<li>Follow the line back to the start, and</li>
<li>Put it down at the starting point.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p class="instruction">Extend your program to let Robo bring back the beacon to the start.</p>
<p class="instruction">Hint: let Robo first paint a black dot where the beacon has to go, so he knows where to put it on his way back ...</p>
